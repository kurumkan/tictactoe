#Tic Tac Toe

Socket.io, Express, React, Redux, rtc.io

Installation 
```npm install```

##important:
According to <a hfref='https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/chrome-47-webrtc?hl=en'>this</a>
```
Starting with Chrome 47, getUserMedia() requests are only allowed from secure origins: HTTPS or localhost.
```

So the webchat will work only if you deploy and run the app over https.
Similar behavior in Opera.
So in order to test videochat functionality through your internal network - you can use mozilla client.
